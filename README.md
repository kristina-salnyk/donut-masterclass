# Donut Masterclass

This project involves the development of a single-page website for the company "Oh My Donut." The website aims to showcase information about the company, its programs, customer reviews, and provide a registration section. The design and implementation adhere to specific requirements to ensure responsiveness, valid markup, semantic HTML, optimized graphics, and other features.
## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The website is crafted with a responsive layout, ensuring optimal viewing experiences on devices of various sizes, starting from 320px width. The design adapts to different breakpoints, enhancing usability.
- **Semantic HTML:** The use of semantic HTML elements ensures a clear and meaningful document structure, contributing to accessibility and SEO best practices.
- **Image Optimization:** Vector and raster graphics are optimized to minimize file sizes while maintaining visual quality. Special attention is given to retina display support for high-resolution screens.
- **Burger Menu Navigation:** On mobile and tablet versions, a burger menu with a smooth animation effect enhances navigation, providing a seamless and user-friendly experience.
- **Read More Feature:** In the "About Us" and "Program" sections for mobile and tablet versions, a "Read more" option allows users to view additional content, enhancing the user experience.
- **Social Media Integration:** The header includes social media icons with hover effects for easy access and sharing.
- **Testimonial Slider:** The "Reviews" section features a slider showcasing testimonials, creating an engaging and dynamic presentation of customer feedback.
- **Support Information:** The footer includes contact information, such as a support hotline and the location of the nearest city.
## Tech Stack

- **HTML:** The latest version of HTML is employed to structure the content, providing a solid foundation for a well-organized webpage.
- **CSS:** Cascading Style Sheets are used for styling, enabling a visually appealing and consistent layout across different sections of the website.
- **SASS:** SASS is utilized to enhance the maintainability and structure of the CSS code. It provides features like variables, nesting, and mixins, contributing to a more modular and scalable stylesheet.
- **JavaScript:** While not mandatory, JavaScript is available for optional enhancements, such as interactivity, dynamic content, and user experience improvements.
- **Swiper:** The Swiper library is integrated to facilitate the implementation of sliders in the "Reviews" section. Swiper provides a responsive and touch-enabled solution for creating engaging and smooth slide presentations.
- **Parsel:** Parsel is employed as a build tool to streamline the development process. It aids in bundling and optimizing the project's assets, making deployment more efficient.
